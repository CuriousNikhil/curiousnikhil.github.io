# The Drafts Section

Use this section to work on things that will eventually end up in `_posts`, but it not ready yet. Leaving drafts in here will ensure they are not included on your live site, but it's easy to preview them  by simply running `jekyll serve` or `jekyll build` with the `--drafts switch`. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
