I am a Software Engineering student at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne. Starting November 2016 I will be interning with [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) in a Data Engineering role.

I'm currently doing a lot of work building developer communities around my University. I'll chase any opportunity to improve collaboration and outreach in the tech. industry.

My main areas of interest are in NLP, Agent-Oriented Programming, and Computational Dialectics.
