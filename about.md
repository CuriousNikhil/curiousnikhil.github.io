Thanks for stopping by!ðŸ˜„<br/>
Hi, I'm Nikhil. Android Engineer @[Paypay Corp](https://helpshift.com), Tokyo, Japan. I work on Paypay's android payment app. 
Previously, I was in [Helpshift](https://helpshift.com) where I worked on developing [_android SDKs_](https://developers.helpshift.com/). 

I am an Android and Kotlin enthusiast <img src="https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180712/wtz/kisspng-android-software-development-kotlin-mobile-app-dev-android-programming-5b47975c864181.2459683915314184605499.jpg" width="20" height="20">. 
I write awesome apps, libraries for Android and Kotlin. You can check my stuff on [Github](https://github.com/CuriousNikhil) and [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mystiko+Labs).

Recently, I've been playing with Jetpack Compose to create animations and generative-art. I post awesome animations on Twitter, do don't forget to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curiousnikhyl) ðŸ˜‰

I also play Percussions - Cajon, Tabla and Dholki (Indian percussions). <br/>
Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikhiil_chaudhari/) to check out my music related content. I usually upload song covers there (I'm not a pro but still..ðŸ˜›).<br/>
Apart from that you will find me cooking, coding and reading in my free time.


Feel free to reach out to me via [mail](nikhyl777@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curiousnikhyl). Always there for help!ðŸ˜Š
