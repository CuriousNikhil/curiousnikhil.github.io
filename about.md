Thanks for stopping by!ðŸ˜„<br/>
Hi, I'm Nikhil. Android Engineer @[Paypay Corp](https://paypay.ne.jp/), Tokyo, Japan. I work on Japan's leading Payment's App. 
I was in [Helpshift](https://helpshift.com), Pune before moving to Japan where I worked on developing [_android SDKs_](https://developers.helpshift.com/). 

I like building apps, libraries and art <img src="https://banner2.cleanpng.com/20180712/wtz/kisspng-android-software-development-kotlin-mobile-app-dev-android-programming-5b47975c864181.2459683915314184605499.jpg" width="20" height="20"> for Android and Kotlin. 
You can check my stuff on [Github](https://github.com/CuriousNikhil) and [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Mystiko+Labs).

Follow me on twitter [@CuriousNikhyl](https://twitter.com/curiousnikhyl) where I upload cool stuff regarding Android, Kotlin, super awesome Jetpack Compose animations and other in general. 

I also play Percussions - Handsonic, Cajon, Tabla and Dholki (Indian percussions). <br/>
Follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikhiil_chaudhari/) to check out my artistry. I usually upload song covers there (I'm not a pro but still..ðŸ˜›).<br/>
Apart from that you will find me cooking, coding and reading in my free time.


Feel free to reach out to me via [mail](nikhyl777@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/curiousnikhyl). Always there for help!ðŸ˜Š DM me your interesting problemsðŸ˜‰!
